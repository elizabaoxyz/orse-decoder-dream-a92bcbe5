                    Through Partner Programs, you may earn commissions (&quot;Commissions&quot;) from such Clients. When a Client pays DoramOS 
                    Commission amounts due under its Partner Program for remittance to you, DoramOS will notify you through the Platform 
                    that the payment may be deposited via the Payment Provider (as described and defined below).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    To be eligible to receive Commission payments, you must maintain an active account on the Platform and set up a valid 
                    payout method. This requires creating a Stripe Express account and completing all necessary identity and other applicable 
                    verifications. If Stripe Express is not available in your country, you may instead use a PayPal account to receive commissions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Commissions are payable only after the applicable Client has paid DoramOS in full for the corresponding transaction. 
                    The Partner Dashboard will indicate the status of your payouts:

If the Partner Program has a minimum payout amount set, your payout amount will need to reach the threshold to become eligible for payment.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-foreground">Processing:</strong> When a Partner Program initiates a payout to you, the payout will be updated to a &quot;processing&quot; state until the payment settles on DoramOS. This process can take up to 5 business days.</li>
